# About

**how2meet** is a *frictionless* event manager--meaning it is simple, free, easy to use, and does **NOT** require you or your guests to:
- Create an account
- Give out your personal information to a service you're not sure that you can trust
- Download an app

Just create your event and send a link with whatever service you choose!

## Motivation

### __Facebook is dead :skull: :__ _But Facebook Events was :fire:_
- Facebook Events
- No one wants to download an app
- Planning a reunion with a big group of distributed, busy friends
- The hardest part of staying connected is someone taking charge and planning events. It takes time, effort, and often little thanks
-

## Features
- [x] Host an event at a specific location, date, and time
- [x] Send invites to guests via link
- [x] Track RSVP responses
- [x] Admin access to change event details

## Roadmap
- [ ] When2meet-style group scheduler
- [ ] GCal URL integration
- [ ] Polls
- [ ] Photos and comments
- [ ] AI-powered planning assistant
- [ ] Alternative communication paths (text, email, whatsapp, etc.)
- [ ] Nudge guests who haven't responded
- [ ] Geo-location search and presentation
- [ ] Admins to limit attendees, kick out unknowns
