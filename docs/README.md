# About

**how2meet** is a *frictionless* event manager--meaning it is simple, free, easy to use, and does **NOT** require you or your guests to:
- Create an account
- Download an app

## Motivation

### __Facebook is dead:__ _But Facebook Events was :fire:_
- Facebook Events
- No one wants to download an app
- Planning a reunion with a big group of distributed, busy friends
- The hardest part of staying connected is someone taking charge and planning events. It takes time, effort, and often little thanks
-

## Features
- [ ] Host an event at a specific location, date, and time
- [ ] Send invites to guests via text, email, or web interface (link)
- [ ] Track RSVP responses, nudge those who haven't responded
- [ ] Admin access to limit attendees, kick out unknowns, change event details, and more!

## Roadmap
- [ ] When2meet-style group scheduler
- [ ] GCal URL integration
- [ ] Polls
- [ ] Photos and comments
- [ ] AI-powered planning assistant
